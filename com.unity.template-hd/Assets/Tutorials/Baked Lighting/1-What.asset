      m_Summary: What is baked lighting?
      m_Description: "Lights have to be baked in order to simulate indirect lighting,
        this is especially important for indoor environments. \n\nIn reality most
        of the objects we see are lit by indirect light that bounced from walls,
        floors and etc. Thus the absence of it is instantly noticeable.\n\nThe image
        above shows the scene when baked data is cleared. As you can see bounced
        light is missing, but there are also a few other key things to take note
        of. When baked data does not exist:\n\n* The sky is used for reflections 
        (set in Lighting->Volumes->Volume Global->Visual Environment)\n\n* All objects
        receive ambient lighting from the sky, light is not occluded (set in Window->Rendering->Environment->Static
        lighting sky)\n\n"
