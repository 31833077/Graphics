      m_Summary: Scene without light probes
      m_Description: 'Look at the image above. <b>Lighting probes</b> were removed
        from the scene. Notice the object looks completely out of place. Why is it
        glowing? As explained in Baked Lighting tutorial, since there is no baked
        data stored for it, the cube uses sky ambient lighting as a fallback. It
        is extremely strong compared to indoor lights.  So if we want our moving
        gameobjects to be in harmony with the scene, we need light probes.


        While
        not necessary, if you would like to follow along and achieve the same result.
        Disable light probes in Lighting->Light Probe Group and rebake the lighting,
        but be aware this process can take more than 10 minutes and double the time
        if you want to undo the change.'
