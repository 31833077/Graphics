      m_Summary: Explore light probes
      m_Description: "Lets take a look how light probes were set up for this scene.\n\nTip:
        If you'd like to match the image above, make sure Gizmos are on, light probes
        are not selected and at the bottom of the Lighting window, set Light Probe
        Visualization to <b>All probes no cells</b>.\n\nAll the scene light probes
        can be found in <i>Hierarchy</i> window <b>Lighting->Light Probe Group</b>.
        They were placed by hand, if you'd select Light Probe Group and in the <i>Inspector</i>
        click <b>Edit Light Probes</b> button, you could select, move or add new
        ones. \n\nWe will not cover how to manually place or create them since there
        is nothing HDRP specific, however will highlight a few key points to have
        in mind:\n\n* Light probes are not realtime, remember to rebake if you made
        drastic changes to lighting.\n\n* Spheres in the image above show at what
        points in the scene lighting data will be sampled. Whenever an object is
        set to receive lighting from light probes(default), the object will receive
        the lighting using a blend from the 4 closest probes. So it is important
        to place probes where a drastic lighting change is occuring, for example
        in a shadow and next to it.\n\n* Even if an object will not move, it doesnt
        mean it should be marked as static and use lightmaps. Using light probes
        instead, even for stationary objects, will reduce baking times and lightmap
        sizes a lot. For example see the chairs in the 3rd room. They are only static
        for reflections and receive lighting from probes. Generally small objects
        should use light probes, not baked lightmaps.\n"
