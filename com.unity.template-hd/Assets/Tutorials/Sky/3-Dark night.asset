      m_Summary: Pure black sky
      m_Description: 'In this step we will put the theory into practice and switch
        the sky to pure black. While in reality such lighting conditions do not exist,
        this should serve as a good exercise to see how things work.


        1)
        Right click in <i>Hierarchy</i> window <b>Volume->Global Volume</b>

        2)
        Set priority to 11, so that settings from other volumes would not interfere

        2)
        In the <i>Inspector</i> window, click <b>New</b>

        3) Click <b>Add
        Override</b> and choose <b>Visual Environment</b>

        4) Choose Type:
        <b>Gradient Sky</b>

        5) Add another override for the volume, search
        for <b>Gradient sky</b>

        6) Choose black color for <b>Top, Middle
        and Bottom</b>

        7) In <i>Hierarchy</i> window, disable the sun <b>Lighting->Sun</b>.
        The result now should match the image above.

        8) Look around in the
        scene, notice even if there is no sky or sun, the 2nd room is still well
        lit. This is because baked Lighting still exists.


        In the next step
        we could go to Lighting tab, choose the Profile that we just created set
        the Static Lighting Sky to Gradient Sky and rebake. But instead lets quickly
        see how to disable lighting data temporarily.


        9) In your volume,
        Add Override called Indirect Lighting Controller

        10) Set each multiplier
        to 0. This will disable baked data.

        11) Look around, only the parths
        of the level that are directly lit are visible. It is expected that the result
        does not look realistic due to missing light bounces.

        12) To revert
        the scene back to normal, enable the Sun and delete the newly created Global
        Volume'
